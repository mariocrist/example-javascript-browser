## Example Demo Page to show Split JS SDK

This is a single page that shows how to set up the JS SDK. Follow the instructions below to make the changes
needed using the information obtained from Split UI.

### Get started

 * Log in to Split console, go to the "Admin Tab" and copy an API token of type "Client-side" in the `authorizationKey` config param in the `index.html`.
 * [Create a Split](CREATESPLIT.md) and assign its name to the variable `featureName` in the `index.html`.
 * Open `index.html` in your browser.
 * [OPTIONAL] Replace the Split script tag in `index.html` to use the new [JS Browser SDK](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360058730852) instead.
